An implementation of the Kalman filter for the course "Introduction to sensor data fusion" @ Uni Bonn

When executing the script, three plots will be generated.
The left plot shows the groundtruth, the measurement, and the filtered and retrodicted result.
The top right shows only the filtered result relative to groundtruth and measurement but also shows the filtered covariances.
The bottom right shows the same but with the retrodicted results and covariances.
